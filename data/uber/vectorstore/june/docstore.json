Refer to Note 13 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates andassumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, whereapplicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, we considered the impacts of the coronaviruspandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments. On an ongoingbasis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement ofcredit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairmentof goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and othercontingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.\n11", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4933, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82234760-5079-4b8c-8b0c-ce521c6a79e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "82234760-5079-4b8c-8b0c-ce521c6a79e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2fd08ee-38ed-4fac-953e-a1c42f088cf5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "e029ff06b5310884389316f0e6800197f3a7d225fcb0dbc776daea92d35a15ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19\nCOVID-19 restrictions have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings.

For further information, see thesection titled \u201cDidi Investment\u201d below.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022, we did not make any other transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nWe measure certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models usingmarket observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quotedmarket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist ofcommon stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately heldcompanies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019sfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of theenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information byusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available marketdata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used inthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\n(1)\n(1)\n(1) \n(1)\n(1) \n14", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3795, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ca36453-51a9-4867-91a3-3b898bf6ea7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ca36453-51a9-4867-91a3-3b898bf6ea7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fccfb6db-86ad-4426-a120-8b8cd98ba9d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "d666fdc8f2de4dfa8024fa1c0a71d04cff89cd312c9add44374b2d995404bcd4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach isemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as themeasurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidatedstatement of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of thesesecurities based on valuation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted forcontractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.\nDidi Investment\nIn the second quarter of 2022, Didi completed their delisting from the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE Delisting\u201d). We concluded the ordinary shares heldby us did not have a readily determinable fair value and should be accounted for under the measurement alternative method. As of June 30, 2022, Didi AmericanDepositary Shares (\u201cADS\u201d) continue to be traded in the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) market. We determined that the Didi ADS were similar to the ordinary sharesheld prior to the NYSE Delisting. We then measured the investment to fair value based on the closing share price of the ADS on the OTC market on June 30, 2022as an observable transaction for similar securities. As a result, we recognized an unrealized gain of $259 million in other income (expense), net in our condensedconsolidated statement of operations during the three months ended June 30, 2022.\nWe did not record any other material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurringbasis during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the total carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis held, includingcumulative unrealized upward and downward adjustments made to the initial cost basis of the securities (in millions):\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021 June 30, 2022\nInitial cost basis $ 279 $ 1,692 \nUpward adjustments 4 263 \nDownward adjustments (including impairment) \u2014 \u2014 \nTotal carrying value at the end of the period $ 283 $ 1,955 \n15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4421, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34dd02e6-6a27-4843-ac64-54c17862a5e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "34dd02e6-6a27-4843-ac64-54c17862a5e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f8ee9d2-36a3-43a6-a310-d5dbb7f36094", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "0eb32143a0bd0baa4fb68f86dcbd224b22bb184d0177f05b61836d626017718e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Note 4 \u2013 Equity Method Investments\nThe carrying value of our equity method investments were as follows (in millions):\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021 June 30, 2022\nMLU B.V. $ 751 $ 471 \nMission Bay 3 & 4 38 34 \nOther 11 16 \nTotal equity method investments $ 800 $ 521 \nMLU B.V.

Basis Difference\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate shareof the net assets of MLU B.V.

Call Option\u201d) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during a two-year periodas part of the agreement with Yandex to restructure our joint ventures in 2021. The MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other currentliabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income(expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.8 billion, subject tocertain adjustments based on the timing of the option exercise.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as ofDecember 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of thecall option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value; option term of 1.7 years; volatility of 50%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price(Level 3).\nAs of June 30, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $23 million, including the recognition of a $181 million gain for the fair value changeduring the three months ended March 31, 2022. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V.

We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $(479) million and $(294) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, and $77million and $(155) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the income taxbenefit was primarily driven by the deferred China and U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Didi, the deferred tax impact related to our investment inAurora, and to a lesser extent, by the benefit from our U.S. losses and current tax on our foreign earnings. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, theincome tax expense was primarily driven by the current tax on our foreign earnings, offset by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora,Zomato, and Grab. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to ourinvestments in Aurora, Grab, Didi, and Zomato, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federalstatutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. andNetherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $77 million, none of which would impact the effectivetax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreigntax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years inwhich the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. Forour major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom(\u201cUK\u201d), and Australia.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefitswithin the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate thefull range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operatinglosses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through June 30, 2022.Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nNote 10 \u2013 Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periodspresented. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect ofoutstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method,as applicable.\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accountedfor using the equity

based on how the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operatingdecisions and evaluates operating performance.\nOur three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\nSegment Description\nMobility Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant orhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery aswell as select other goods.\nFreight Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book ashipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region, refer to Note 2 \u2013Revenue.\nOur segment operating performance measure is segment adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and,accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue,operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segmentadjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the tablebelow).

As of December 31, 2021 and June30, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion, of which $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters in accrued and other current liabilities on thecondensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independentcontractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfaircompetition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d)claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and auditproceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of CaliforniaState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number ofmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount orrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results ofoperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matterswere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materiallyadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workersperforming services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019scontrol, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type ofbusiness performed for the hiring entity.\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed apetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result ofthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required tocomply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.\nThe California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court following the appellateproceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction withthe trial court. On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the stipulation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4863, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55819610-90c5-430d-853a-cf59f0581ee2": {"__data__": {"id_": "55819610-90c5-430d-853a-cf59f0581ee2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed54981a-b4b2-4ad4-a195-e212e87ec9df", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "0070bcd459246ed3ab13b2dccaf30d6bf27c8333b313749dc1d2835f0d796880", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "191b4134-ef3a-41e8-875d-97bc72caad2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "7f15666ef17d781a45c89c3c01fc907f40ffb53f2100bc43dcf50dc108a15721", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Proposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers.

Since the assignment of thecoordination judge, the case remains stayed as to discovery. We intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves.

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.\nIn April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. andRaiser Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the Appin 2014 as dependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the FederalTribunal and has no impact on our current operations. On June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by which both Drivers and Couriers in the canton ofGeneva are classified as employees of Uber BV and Uber Switzerland GmbH.\nFollowing this ruling, we received a request for information from the SVA Z\u00fcrich that states that Couriers shall be considered employees for social securitypurposes since the launch of Uber Eats. The ultimate resolution of the matters before the social security authorities is uncertain and the amount accrued for thosematters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022.\nAslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\nOn October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting thatthey should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. Thetribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment ofthe App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing atthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment lawpurposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wagewhen driving with Uber.

Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million againstAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable.

In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussioncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statementsand Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by theforward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point Ato point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers ofride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with publictransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freightindustry by providing carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologies thatprovide new solutions to everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to thealleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019spreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda CountySuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the CaliforniaCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, resultsof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) EmploymentTribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK ratherthan independent contractors.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5231, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29e8924a-fd6e-4ddd-981c-70872547aa16": {"__data__": {"id_": "29e8924a-fd6e-4ddd-981c-70872547aa16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0ea29644-d8fe-40a6-bee8-dce4adeab3a4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "119d886ec13be8ce8188bb6c023ce3746ace7f5eac22c30eba675657078d832f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca4484a2-5eb9-4a84-a1ad-25fdb37f1152", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "72cffed2e3e7c15c114981dcb74310b92d45f9ab0c0926a4a81eed12bdbad406", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the CaliforniaCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.

We appealedto the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UKdrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage.

We have concluded that we are an agent in thesearrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driverincentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobilityservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in thetransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible formobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers inexchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,\u201d \u201cNote 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - RevenueRecognition,\u201d and \u201cNote 2 - Revenue\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,2021 and Note 2 \u2013 Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, creditcard processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight transportationservices, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we areprimarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Tripvolume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-locateddata center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations incities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customersupport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on anabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertisingcosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation ofcertain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for theforeseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design andproduct development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs.

The increase inGross Bookings was primarily driven by a $3.0 billion increase in Freight revenue resulting primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of2021 and increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, during the first half of 2022, we saw a $1.2billion net increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK. Revenue in the first half of 2021 included the unfavorable impact of a$600 million accrual for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $246 millionas of June 30, 2022.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cashequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, respectively. We didnot have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of June 30, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds andcash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changesin rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rateswould not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to valuegiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. Theseinvestments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fairvalue of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period oftime after a public offering. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $5.1 billion, including equity method investments.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operatingresults as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversifiedacross geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter intoderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\n52", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5242, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eea946b7-6d56-44fd-b0f0-5f683583a476": {"__data__": {"id_": "eea946b7-6d56-44fd-b0f0-5f683583a476", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "08c95324-90c2-4c28-be87-32cbd29e7a16", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "421f5e437ff471c4931991d075c2f380fb845d54e7358632287cd161a3dcceb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that wefile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of ourdisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

However, ourmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that itsobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all controlissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage tothe class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the sameAustralian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against thelawsuit.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for thematters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legalproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims relatedto the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States wherewe may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations inwhich we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary andinterim rulings.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the followingrisks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and the relatednotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Ourbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do notbelieve are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\u2022 Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\u2022 The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\u2022 To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\u2022 We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u2022 If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\n\u2022 Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negativepublicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain andenhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n\u2022 Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address thesechallenges may not be successful.\n\u2022 If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will beadversely affected.\n54", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5020, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c0e8c10-f614-43c5-8237-8edddf9d10e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c0e8c10-f614-43c5-8237-8edddf9d10e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7dee377-74ba-40c7-8794-7464aba9c470", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "4e83a78e887b17548952b29c4743dd779bfc7a2d8d30603b0ba1c288aa7f603d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u2022 Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which mayharm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\n\u2022 We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future.

We areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, andprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individualsettlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $457 million as of June 30, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legalproceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negativelyimpact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independentcontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independentcontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to befiled.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expensesassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly affected.Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and wemay not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change ourbusiness model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAnother example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by theEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan self-employed).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5395, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ff4e98d-1225-41cd-878f-dba534957f49": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ff4e98d-1225-41cd-878f-dba534957f49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7c2d195-4c75-4956-8f4d-7796165fc142", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "3be0baf120759195911d9f1aef04be30e13e90cd47f459f29575a817c4489d04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "49037284-33f2-408c-845b-fecd91f3881a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "ccd9e156e021fd904a5e6132b3fdff5421f6da04ce5c3aa446eb357b3a1efe95", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly affected.Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and wemay not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform.

If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity toshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on alimited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner thanwe do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Inaddition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers valuemore highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competition could result in,among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, andour margins.\nWe face competition in each of our offerings, including:\n\u2022 Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in themarkets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services.

These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficientlyto offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costscould prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability.

A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurant groups and othermerchants, and this concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced byour significant restaurant partners.

While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similarwork, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives toimprove our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\nOften, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely beviewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and securitybreaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers andmerchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in ourautonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resultedin protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests mayresult, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce ournetwork liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage. Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, orcarriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our future operating results.\nIn addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers toour platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to makedeliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible toprovide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materiallydifferent type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in anefficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including anychanges to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time requiredto recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider incertain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Thefailure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoingperiodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects.

Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Courierson two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than thatfaced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition,Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavilycongested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours, all of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liabilityand general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. Theseincidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and futureprospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products andofferings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherentlyrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing newtechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in severalcountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiaryUber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight\u2019s business through Transplace\u2019s expertise in transportation management. We also plan to investsignificant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend ourdevelopment budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy.Our new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we havelimited or no prior development or operating experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities (including,but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not currently anticipate.\nThere can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiativeswill gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It isalso possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development effortswith respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from ourmore established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory authorities maysubject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercializing newproducts, offerings or technologies.

Furthermore, the value of theseassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affectsuch valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies couldadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companieshave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limitedpublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particulareconomic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; aredomiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and effortsof a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect onthe relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitivepositions.

The broaderconsequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensionsbetween the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these riskscould materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of ourcommon stock.\nFurther, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets.

For example, if we were deemed an investment companyunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we wouldnot be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.Accordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adverselyaffected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety offactors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.

For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in ourrevenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonalfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth ofDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficultto detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonaltrends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate asa result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand ouroperations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace withtechnological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation,and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemmingfrom continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrierdemand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees invarious jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adverselyimpacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will notachieve profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in largemetropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adverselyimpacted.\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Pauloin Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results aresusceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagiousdiseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in suchmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our\n66", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4969, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3256a71b-55c7-44b1-98b1-b8fa51c61240": {"__data__": {"id_": "3256a71b-55c7-44b1-98b1-b8fa51c61240", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c032c2e4-c03f-4222-b396-01dad41043dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "3cd48a0559859915d467653bf3fff36f22c634249e5ef7f390a16fffdb3c83b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "87d0c7e0-03f7-42c7-8080-60163b213ca9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a786dbad1f5ba677c599d9ef1470ceeca28521c74b8a8d10937918ccf34b4c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.

As a result of this concentration, ouroperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to andfrom airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including bymandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have bannedridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While wehave entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airportboundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similaragreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if suchtechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on ourplatform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investmentin the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in whichwe compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla,Apple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with carmanufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has alreadyintroduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlierthan we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners. In the event that ourcompetitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to besuperior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to competemore effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantiallyreduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price ascompared to the price available to consumers on our platform.

Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we recently implemented our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challengesmaintaining our corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, increasing attrition orlimiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress andsocial isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or additional negative publicitycould lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee turnover.

We haveentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans.

As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities forbreaches experienced by the companies we acquire.

Forexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features.

If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets inwhich Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, manyjurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to complywith these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in thosejurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks forDrivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safetyincidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any ofthese concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cashreceived for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not alwayseffective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannotguarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to avariety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail,we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collectionfailure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact ourfinancial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card.

Additionally, concerns over theeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock priceand our ability to access capital markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect ofheightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are notcurrently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-costalternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and usedvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and maycontinue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs,increased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certaininternational markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, theseincreased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, theseincreased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchantsto cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline.

We may not be able to easily switchto another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data centerproviders are subject to the same risks.

While we employ practices designed to monitorour compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open sourcelicense review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms ofsuch license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract.

If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, ourability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness maylimit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $235 million ofCareem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of June 30, 2022. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing andfuture indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incuradditional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reducethe funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for workingcapital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten ourvulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business andthe industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flowfrom operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or tofund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cashfrom operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.\nIn addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations,including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on thepayment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raisingactivities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities,including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit ourability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\nIn addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled \u201cManagement'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\u201d\nWe may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nThe tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. For example, wemay become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many othermultinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate.Currently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our compliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could oweadditional taxes.\nCertain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowedto contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those mattersare being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subjectto such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously.

In addition, the determination of our worldwideprovision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by our management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which theultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affectour financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannotaccurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which could impact our financial position. In addition, in connection withany planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for notbeing at arm\u2019s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation ofsuch acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurringadditional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017,and modified in 2020, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation andregulations promulgated in connection therewith remain unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as wellas interpretations and incremental implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen orincrease certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state andlocal taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. Furthermore, beginning on January 1, 2022,the Act eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize theseexpenses. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provisionwill be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not repealed or modified, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be adverselyimpacted by this legislation.\nWe are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability thatwe have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates wherewe have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potentialchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We couldbecome subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmentalbodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted andhistorically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our taxobligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expandingscale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm ourfinancial position, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and$12.4 billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income.

It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, joint ventures, or other strategic transactions weannounce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or regulators, any or all of which may adversely affect our reputation and ourbusiness. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions orlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of anexisting license or permit.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4971, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1717049c-c514-422c-bbb1-33d353741a4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1717049c-c514-422c-bbb1-33d353741a4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1a7a094-b863-46f0-ad66-3b618a4c28e0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "29f6a707bc44740fd4c08e89c508a5602e674154002ffb16917ac3668b611e3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d4d6d04-e5a1-4641-b8d8-91218548777b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "89ee1730a6f46585730624da652d0fbb6cf0e3a53f79fdc413c920ea591eadc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "InAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains.

Inaddition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or thatwe believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who usedthe Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges and possible policy solutions.

As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering ourMobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled that we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changesto our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched Mobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order toblock Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in certain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess theapplicability of these laws and regulations to our products and offerings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to ourability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to continue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subjectto scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this practice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Driversimposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our licenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Suchfines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services onour platform. In many instances, we make the business decision as a gesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers\u2019 defense costs,which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of dollars. Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourageDrivers and consumers from using our platform and could adversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for byour competitors or from local governments globally, that have favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potentialDrivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle certifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee capswith respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur,significant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit ouroperations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue andgrowth would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\nAs of June 30, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 70 countries. We are subject to differing, and sometimesconflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional,and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how weoperate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws andregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medicaltransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are activelychallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharingservices. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effectin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto electric vehicles by 2025.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5347, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1cb1312-ffe9-4d7c-a274-47f00ce91aad": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1cb1312-ffe9-4d7c-a274-47f00ce91aad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84cc7a44-735f-4005-85f8-8d01133053e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "34d50d053b6f0fa69af09676b0f0ca3e4bac7f2128c7fbded31025aaad7c0be5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d997d8f-054e-4e68-9b2c-fd0f4045d407", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "3c8fcf3f64cfb49c830607354fb7f855141663e5ae4539e303c67b7659af2008", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We are activelychallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharingservices.

For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia onbehalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions of Australia during certainperiods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods. These legislative andregulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in financial damages orpenalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which could harm our abilityto operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, revenue, and operatingresults.\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negativepublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims ofanti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are toohigh (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both.

Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and,therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, oroperating results.\nWe expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focuson the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of aninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC.

Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involvesubstantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users notcompleting all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services receivedby those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumerscould adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide paymentprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European paymentsregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulations.\nIn addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions. Our business operations, including our payments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations.Historical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets, orother enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on ourability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand sanctions laws, and in the EEA to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider.Government authorities may seek to bring legal action against us if our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise riskmanagement or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.\nWe currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, other federal, state and local governmentagencies and other foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.\nWe are the subject of DOJ inquiries and investigations, as well as civil enforcement inquiries and investigations by other federal, state and local governmentagencies and other regulators abroad.

TheGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) specialcategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\n83", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4025, "end_char_idx": 6914, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f0a5472-f4f8-4229-8ef9-75271387ed83": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f0a5472-f4f8-4229-8ef9-75271387ed83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e6888360-d759-472d-9c50-13dadbea4d97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "c7d1bb56ef5209e72f4d53ddb6fb9e8b5daea5fe841769bdc6adf88e802fc6a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b29a1e0e-db5f-4fcd-a044-415c2295e2c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e995bb4f98b5dc90f7abfc865522e257f903b17ab2adb6479ee8f29caf45fbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazilprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal dataoutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either atemporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound liable, significant damages.

However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome.Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing publicscrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, inany legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15,2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rulesbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories ofprotection.

Ouracquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not befamiliar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws.

Insurance related to ourMobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on alimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including generalliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a mannerunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States andCanada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significantadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of therisk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of ourinsurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained byus through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, andindustry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves.

As a result, our automobile liability and general liabilityinsurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed tohave been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not resultin liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise validclaims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negativepublicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us bygovernmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.
