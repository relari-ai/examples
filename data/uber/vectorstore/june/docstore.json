\u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a\ntechnology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects\nconsumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers\n(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and\nother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to\nas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product\nexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry by providing carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other\nlogistics services. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia\n(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) regarding interim financial reporting. The\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.\nCertain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted\npursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\nresults for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the\nfinancial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented.\nThere have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed\nwith the SEC on February 24, 2022 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nBasis of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest and\nvoting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Refer to Note 13 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where\napplicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, we considered the impacts of the coronavirus\npandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments. On an ongoing\nbasis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of\ncredit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment\nof goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other\ncontingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.\n11", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4959, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c9d41c6-3464-4005-b142-adb23ad4794d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c9d41c6-3464-4005-b142-adb23ad4794d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "73fa6c30-b017-474e-a731-8c443f0e657d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "1f1e767fcabaea26e05d7e4488b38d554840e313449f29b1f80b08cf75856d02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "01e21db5-71f4-47bb-8c3a-fb37aa3ec667", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "1c970ffedcbffe7483ce2894144da4e408afb02288c00d9574b0caf368a47f76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e155433-fa79-4125-8abd-aaa7041bc4a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cdde13ca577aabe54b0c6df74a617ddee8dedb404e24875fc2cfc14cda2b911b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19\nCOVID-19 restrictions have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings.

The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning\nafter December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted.

We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the\ntransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for\nmobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in\nexchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nDelivery Revenue\nWe derive revenue for Delivery from Merchants\u2019 and Couriers\u2019 use of the Delivery platform and related service to facilitate and complete Delivery\ntransactions.\nAdditionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while\npayments to Couriers in exchange for delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue. In these markets, we recognized revenue from end-users of $174 million\nand $262 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, and revenue from end-users of $344 million and $585 million for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022, respectively. We also recognized cost of revenue for these delivery transactions, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $536\nmillion and $889 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, and cost of revenue of $940 million and $1.7 billion for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022, respectively.\nDelivery also includes advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising services.\nFreight Revenue\nFreight revenue consists of revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition\nof Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d), and as a result, our Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management.\nAll Other Revenue\nPrior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily includes collaboration revenue related to our Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) business and revenue from\nour New Mobility offerings and products.\nContract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation\nContract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying our performance obligations. As of June 30, 2022, we had $150 million of contract\nliabilities included in accrued and other current liabilities as well as other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized\nfrom these contracts during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022 was not material.\nOur remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year is expected to be recognized as follows (in\nmillions):\nLess Than or Equal To 12 Months Greater Than 12 Months Total\nAs of June 30, 2022$ 33 $ 115 $ 148 \nNote 3 \u2013 Investments and Fair Value Measurement\nInvestments\nOur investments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets consisted of the following (in millions):\n13", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3727, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42792e4c-c7af-4c95-83dc-d0798b200d6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "42792e4c-c7af-4c95-83dc-d0798b200d6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c828092-098a-46b8-87cc-46a4f4d31bda", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "f6680ada8592cceaa52c254b7f1a3c8f8961f1790dcf170a3fbfd4836932e5c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e155433-fa79-4125-8abd-aaa7041bc4a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "1d868862dbab6ad8bc3d798d7ae6208b505875889bd60b3a62a74fef632bef02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2bddc424-b83f-4dce-b74e-7f96458cde86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d50aac805ea7c57b214f5fac20c61e897a89aba9fc4bae3665bc9143a031c66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As of\nDecember 31, 2021 June 30, 2022\nNon-marketable equity securities:\nDidi $ \u2014 $ 1,669 \nOther 315 298 \nMarketable equity securities:\nDidi 2,838 \u2014 \nGrab 3,821 1,356 \nAurora 3,388 575 \nOther 1,312 548 \nNote receivable from a related party 132 126 \nInvestments $ 11,806 $ 4,572 \nThese balances include certain investments recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings due to the election of the fair value option\nof accounting for financial instruments.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy (in\nmillions):\nAs of December 31, 2021 As of June 30, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFinancial Assets\nNon-marketable equity securities $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 32 $ 32 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 12 $ 12 \nMarketable equity securities 11,359 \u2014 \u2014 11,359 2,479 \u2014 \u2014 2,479 \nNote receivable from a related party \u2014 \u2014 132 132 \u2014 \u2014 126 126 \nTotal financial assets $11,359 $ \u2014 $ 164 $11,523 $ 2,479 $ \u2014 $ 138 $ 2,617 \nFinancial Liabilities\nMLU B.V.

For further information, see the\nsection titled \u201cDidi Investment\u201d below.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022, we did not make any other transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nWe measure certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2\ninstrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using\nmarket observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted\nmarket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of\ncommon stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held\ncompanies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019s\nfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the\nenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by\nusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market\ndata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in\nthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.(1)\n(1)\n(1) \n(1)\n(1) \n14", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3807, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bddc424-b83f-4dce-b74e-7f96458cde86": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bddc424-b83f-4dce-b74e-7f96458cde86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e67db56-aed7-4289-8c86-dd4ccaf951f7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "66869f2076eb7ae9f80665553ef57c5d73343f113eab02d5364d77808a1f730d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "42792e4c-c7af-4c95-83dc-d0798b200d6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "f6680ada8592cceaa52c254b7f1a3c8f8961f1790dcf170a3fbfd4836932e5c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c30674b-d815-4763-a93f-3a8c5a9ed4fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f5ca4b939083beaa0be4f1a18fbd63825c479aa94870f1a8445b6f9c59b7d440", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us.

The carrying value of our non-\nmarketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the\nmeasurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these\nsecurities based on valuation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for\ncontractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.\nDidi Investment\nIn the second quarter of 2022, Didi completed their delisting from the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE Delisting\u201d). We concluded the ordinary shares held\nby us did not have a readily determinable fair value and should be accounted for under the measurement alternative method. As of June 30, 2022, Didi American\nDepositary Shares (\u201cADS\u201d) continue to be traded in the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) market. We determined that the Didi ADS were similar to the ordinary shares\nheld prior to the NYSE Delisting. We then measured the investment to fair value based on the closing share price of the ADS on the OTC market on June 30, 2022\nas an observable transaction for similar securities.

The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the\nRussian economy as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencing\nrevenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.\nMLU B.V. Basis Difference\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate share\nof the net assets of MLU B.V.

Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for\ncurrency translation adjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar. The Ruble appreciated\nagainst the U.S. dollar by approximately 64% between March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.

Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current\nliabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income\n(expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.8 billion, subject to\ncertain adjustments based on the timing of the option exercise.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V.

We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $(479) million and $(294) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, and $77\nmillion and $(155) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the income tax\nbenefit was primarily driven by the deferred China and U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Didi, the deferred tax impact related to our investment in\nAurora, and to a lesser extent, by the benefit from our U.S. losses and current tax on our foreign earnings. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the\nincome tax expense was primarily driven by the current tax on our foreign earnings, offset by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora,\nZomato, and Grab. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our\ninvestments in Aurora, Grab, Didi, and Zomato, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal\nstatutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and\nNetherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $77 million, none of which would impact the effective\ntax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign\ntax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in\nwhich the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For\nour major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom\n(\u201cUK\u201d), and Australia.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits\nwithin the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the\nfull range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operating\nlosses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through June 30, 2022.\nBased on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nNote 10 \u2013 Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods\npresented. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of\noutstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method,\nas applicable.\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted\nfor using the equity

consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,\nmotorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or\nhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as\nwell as select other goods.\nFreight Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a\nshipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region, refer to Note 2 \u2013\nRevenue.\nOur segment operating performance measure is segment adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and,\naccordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue,\noperations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment\nadjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table\nbelow).

As of December 31, 2021 and June\n30, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion, of which $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters in accrued and other current liabilities on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent\ncontractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair\ncompetition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d)\nclaims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.\nWe have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit\nproceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California\nState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of\nmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters\nwere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially\nadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\n\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers\nperforming services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s\ncontrol, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of\nbusiness performed for the hiring entity.\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in\nSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages\nrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed a\npetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November\n2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of\nthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to\ncomply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.\nThe California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court following the appellate\nproceedings on February 22, 2021.

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.\nIn April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and\nRaiser Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App\nin 2014 as dependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal\nTribunal and has no impact on our current operations. On June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by which both Drivers and Couriers in the canton of\nGeneva are classified as employees of Uber BV and Uber Switzerland GmbH.\nFollowing this ruling, we received a request for information from the SVA Z\u00fcrich that states that Couriers shall be considered employees for social security\npurposes since the launch of Uber Eats. The ultimate resolution of the matters before the social security authorities is uncertain and the amount accrued for those\nmatters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022.\nAslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\nOn October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that\nthey should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The\ntribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of\nthe App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at\nthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law\npurposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage\nwhen driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a\nsettlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.

Compensation hearings will take place for\nclaimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.

Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March\n26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million against\nAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its\nrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and\nGoogle entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-\nlooking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements\nand Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the\nforward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A\nto point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of\nride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight\nindustry by providing carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologies that\nprovide new solutions to everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the\nalleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of\nProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,\nwhich was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California\nCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y.

We appealed\nto the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK\ndrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring\ntheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage\nwhen driving with Uber.

We have concluded that we are an agent in these\narrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver\nincentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility\nservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the\ntransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for\nmobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in\nexchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,\u201d \u201cNote 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue\nRecognition,\u201d and \u201cNote 2 - Revenue\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2021 and Note 2 \u2013 Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit\ncard processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight transportation\nservices, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are\nprimarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip\nvolume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located\ndata center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers.

We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the\nforeseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and\nproduct development.

Additionally, during the first half of 2022, we saw a $1.2\nbillion net increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK. Revenue in the first half of 2021 included the unfavorable impact of a\n$600 million accrual for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\nour condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100\nbasis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $246 million\nas of June 30, 2022.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, respectively. We did\nnot have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of June 30, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and\ncash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes\nin rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates\nwould not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and\nrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value\ngiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These\ninvestments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair\nvalue of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of\ntime after a public offering. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $5.1 billion, including equity method investments.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\nthe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified\nacross geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement\nof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4987, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3635f1df-eb16-4605-89ee-88f204013e50": {"__data__": {"id_": "3635f1df-eb16-4605-89ee-88f204013e50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1cfb0168-8803-4512-9e65-bf588bf1a4ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "ac73610507cee2cb651bfce1dbb757f244933b37aaefcc91da73d8fd34668543", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "69c0b4ee-4eb0-49ca-b8ce-b47cd1edffec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "8383fce860f6b05be917a0d6d9d175fe3421cf70aeaab5272417560cca05e523", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0313bab-ab4c-495a-a897-6e7dbca1a251", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f495b1d9df3f477a46dda48dde37702bd6df097383ee0e3b87c125f4050158df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\nthe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we\nfile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule\n13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe acquired Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in November 2021. As part of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, we are\nreviewing the internal controls of Transplace and are making appropriate changes as we deem necessary. Other than the controls related to Transplace, there were\nno changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our\nmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its\nobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal\nproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related\nto the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where\nwe may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in\nwhich we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.

RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following\nrisks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and the related\nnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\noperating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not\nbelieve are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\u2022Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\u2022The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,\nlow barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\u2022To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,\nand may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\nsignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u2022If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other\nfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\n\u2022Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative\npublicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and\nenhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n\u2022Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these\nchallenges may not be successful.\n\u2022If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be\nadversely affected.\n54", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5038, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09d84410-6722-426c-9e29-daee0d0c49bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "09d84410-6722-426c-9e29-daee0d0c49bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f3d4882a-3271-46aa-80b5-714df381c136", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "0e1feb564569210d9b53f07c3f8c5e30c24ebd05563e9c74be9681a681cfb11e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0b18c6b-083d-4301-a606-cf5bc33cec30", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "ef5dc1ec2c0cfc64c47452ff4c8df430e43195f2e53a0e85ae2242d98119ddc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0851cf2e-a9fb-4907-803b-b58616079752", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce4a83ad550bd6e84cacb56510cccf32a1e9d90508bc8a2ff672ca50a6c0b6da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may\nharm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\n\u2022We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future.

We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)\narbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual\nsettlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $457 million as of June 30, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal\nproceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively\nimpact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\nDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have\nbrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like\nours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be\nfiled.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,\nalleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we\nmay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial\ndecisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses\nassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social\nsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional\ncosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly affected.\nAdditionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we\nmay not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our\nbusiness model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAnother example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v.

If we are unable to compete effectively in these\nindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are\nhighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and\nCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers\nto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to\nshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other\nmerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of\norders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a\nlimited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than\nwe do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In\naddition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value\nmore highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competition could result in,\namong other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and\nour margins.\nWe face competition in each of our offerings, including:\n\u2022 Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the\nmarkets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In\naddition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in\nmany cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including\nLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\n\u2022 Delivery.

Moreover, certain of our stockholders, including SoftBank (a large stockholder), have made substantial investments in certain\nof our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the\nfuture. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more\neffectively against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers,\nmerchants, shippers, and carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or\nmaintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively\nnascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\nsignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2021, and as of June 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $32.2 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease\nproportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be\nable to maintain or increase\n58", "start_char_idx": 4152, "end_char_idx": 6584, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3181923-defe-410d-8708-3a2fb8dd6577": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3181923-defe-410d-8708-3a2fb8dd6577", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7cbcd38b-2d44-437a-97dc-350a7db2fe55", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "4620cf9bed875377dc773ddfe691d23bbfb707903b590f5e7db6a48c0295693b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a014db8a-90a3-44b8-9bde-67131aec66af", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "aaef6c069f379bcce573537cec395f9cb3ade93260dcfcd4b9db2b4d23425722", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "38711c33-ef7a-4140-af21-98e8addbb759", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "18d52a4c56e932dced4ddd03ac8ee1ccdcab2c04648f0856d543516422d70529", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses, as we continue to invest in order to:\nincrease the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts, and promotions; expand within\nexisting or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire additional employees; and add new\nproducts and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently\nto offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costs\ncould prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to add value to our overall platform\nand network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower service fee to certain of our largest\nchain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a negative take rate with respect to those\ntransactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in these cities\nmay be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the near term, in\naccordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem\nand Postmates, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in the United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do\nexperience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the near term.\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other\nfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.\nOur success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to maintain or increase our network scale and liquidity in that geographic market\nby attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, or elect to\noffer them through a competitor\u2019s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We have experienced\nand expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have been and may\ncontinue to be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market,\nwe may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that we experience\nin that market. Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of\ncarriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in a specific\ngeographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, we may lack\na sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offering will become\nless appealing to consumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurant groups and other\nmerchants, and this concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by\nour significant restaurant partners. If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lack sufficient opportunities for\nDrivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform. An insufficient supply\nof platform users would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we may benefit from having larger network\nscale and liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcome by smaller competitors.

While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar\nwork, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to\nimprove our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\nOften, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely be\nviewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security\nbreaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and\nmerchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our\nautonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted\nin protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may\nresult, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our\nnetwork liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage. Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or\ncarriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our future operating results.\nIn addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to\nour platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,\nprosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make\ndeliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to\nprovide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially\ndifferent type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an\nefficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any\nchanges to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required\nto recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in\ncertain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The\nfailure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing\nperiodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects.

These\nincidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future\nprospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and\nofferings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently\nrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new\ntechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several\ncountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,\nwhich operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary\nUber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight\u2019s business through Transplace\u2019s expertise in transportation management. We also plan to invest\nsignificant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our\ndevelopment budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy.\nOur new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have\nlimited or no prior development or operating experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities (including,\nbut not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not currently anticipate.\nThere can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiatives\nwill gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is\nalso possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts\nwith respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our\nmore established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory authorities may\nsubject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercializing new\nproducts, offerings or technologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects\nmay be harmed.\nOur business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we are\nunable to manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we operated in approximately 70 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 75% of all Trips. We have\nlimited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to expand\nour international operations and compete with local and other global competitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not be successful\nand may negatively affect our operating results.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5161, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb0f2a62-e15f-4694-9255-17d0726fc089": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb0f2a62-e15f-4694-9255-17d0726fc089", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85b867e3-cdd1-48f3-9146-9e9e3d835fc0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "8de1c350e12dc07a7f4bde5fe1561c02e3e9650804c5210424dcbafc34ef7c71", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f7aa926-42c4-4a42-b615-3098a6696383", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "ad9e80520f2d06042467f411e2a92adfc3a18bb230944e1672a4af76af256ee5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3e4e9bd-2e10-44bb-96bc-3c5e85c3c8da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b5c9bfba84cecbe162120ff35852603f4d5fdf1688ceec4e9f0af6509e9f88d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects\nmay be harmed.\nOur business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we are\nunable to manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we operated in approximately 70 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 75% of all Trips.

Furthermore, the value of these\nassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect\nsuch valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could\nadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies\nhave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited\npublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particular\neconomic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; are\ndomiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts\nof a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on\nthe relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive\npositions. For example, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, members of our management team resigned from the board of our Yandex.Taxi joint\nventure, and we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in the joint venture. The broader\nconsequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions\nbetween the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks\ncould materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of our\ncommon stock.\nFurther, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora\u2019s November 2021 initial public\noffering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Other than Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, there is currently no public market for\nany of these securities, and there may be no market in the future if and when we decide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a\ntime at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would\nnot be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.\nAccordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely\naffected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance.

Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult\nto detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal\ntrends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as\na result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our\noperations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with\ntechnological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation,\nand other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming\nfrom continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier\ndemand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in\nvarious jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not\nachieve profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large\nmetropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted.\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo\nin Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives\nand consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are\nsusceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious\ndiseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in\nwhich we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics\nor pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,\nor regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater\ndegree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect\nour ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew\nexisting licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such\nmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our\n66", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4993, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c366e0a-c431-4777-9261-2d7dd42f56a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c366e0a-c431-4777-9261-2d7dd42f56a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e4636ea-5b9f-46b5-a186-d89d762b21ff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "e9e778e0e7a0379d1a49e689984bc368a08b32a0a0be2cfad91a2227233adcb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "782cf2ae-bc90-49a9-822a-5e42f1f2d681", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "82e7457c45de1ee1508d9bca12cef0ecb242052eb0f2eca1756ca7622f820065", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d8cf597-c1d5-4210-ae08-34912dcd97b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a2ba0c75489c82c12d082e24ec38baf63aab9e511e000aa24bdc292481914eda", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in\npenetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our\ntotal addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and\nfrom airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related\nMobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by\nmandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned\nridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the\nrequisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against\nus or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our\noperations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-\nimposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we\nhave entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport\nboundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar\nagreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such\ntechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-\nautonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our\nplatform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment\nin the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-\ndriving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which\nwe compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla,\nApple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car\nmanufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has already\nintroduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier\nthan we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners. In the event that our\ncompetitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be\nsuperior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete\nmore effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially\nreduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as\ncompared to the price available to consumers on our platform.

Challenges related to our historical culture and\nworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.\nOur employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we recently implemented our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,\nwhich includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges\nmaintaining our corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, increasing attrition or\nlimiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19\nmore generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and\nsocial isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or additional negative publicity\ncould lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of senior\nmanagement or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives and\nemployees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.\nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We have\nentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration.

The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel\ntransitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person\u2019s skills, knowledge of our business, and\nyears of industry experience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future business\nprospects could be adversely affected.\nTo attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to attract and retain the personnel\nwe require to operate our business effectively.

We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in May 2014, we experienced a data\nsecurity incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an\nemployee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the \u201c2014 Breach\u201d). In October and November of 2016,\noutside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the \u201c2016 Breach\u201d). The accessed data included the\nnames, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and drivers\u2019 license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information\non this incident, see the risk factors titled \u201c\u2014We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state\nAttorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business\u201d and \u201c\u2014We face risks\nrelated to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and\nregulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,\u201d below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for\nbreaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had\nbeen subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem\nbecomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we\nexperience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been\nsubject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final\ncourt approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or\nother data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business\ndisruption, and significant liabilities.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we may\nfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nTo continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of\nnew products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For\nexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about\nrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further\nstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features\ndepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features.

For example, some product changes in\nCalifornia have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and\nadverse impacts on the operation of our platform.

For example, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Terms of\nService and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the\ndata that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics or our\nestimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not\nperceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to be accurate, or if we discover material\ninaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, and\nsafety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other\nadverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow\nconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).\nIn 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in\nwhich Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many\njurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply\nwith these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those\njurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for\nDrivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety\nincidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of\nthese concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may\ncontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash\nreceived for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always\neffective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot\nguarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a\nvariety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail,\nwe may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection\nfailure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our\nfinancial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly\nlimit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry\n(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d).

Additionally, concerns over the\neconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price\nand our ability to access capital markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of\nheightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not\ncurrently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on\ndiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage\nmarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost\nalternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use\none of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public\ntransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity\nand may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the\nmerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases\nfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at\nmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products\nand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or\nalternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used\nvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and may\ncontinue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs,\nincreased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certain\ninternational markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these\nincreased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these\nincreased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants\nto cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased supply of\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could harm our business and operating results.\nDependencies on Third Parties\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our\ncontrol.\nOur business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.

We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces\nwill not charge us fees to list our applications for download.

If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not\nprovide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may\nbe required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely\naffect our business.\nOur business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our\nplatform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platform\nacross these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control.

This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss of\ndata, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch\nto another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center\nproviders are subject to the same risks.

Any subsequent integration or continued operation of\nsuch acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring\nadditional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017,\nand modified in 2020, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and\nregulations promulgated in connection therewith remain unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well\nas interpretations and incremental implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or\nincrease certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and\nlocal taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. Furthermore, beginning on January 1, 2022,\nthe Act eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize these\nexpenses. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision\nwill be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not repealed or modified, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be adversely\nimpacted by this legislation.\nWe are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our\nbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability that\nwe have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where\nwe have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potential\nchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We could\nbecome subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental\nbodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and\nhistorically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax\nobligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expanding\nscale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our\nfinancial position, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and\n$12.4 billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5067, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fe263e1-792a-4e88-948b-68e278440515": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fe263e1-792a-4e88-948b-68e278440515", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7940526-439b-43df-9c3a-51350df11797", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "129bccf3568be9a78f49d4b3315608f27d36fa82b0c21a6b8775cd2aad4e297c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7a5e4d5-a9e2-42cd-9f8e-0efaa38856eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "0f6d268209c4db2243f770f7abfdc984869942a7b0c7cbf40d5b6040e048d74a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "988aa0f4-dd22-48d4-96a4-52ea0eaf3fed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "73d1d332c73218ecd6a8327c25a05d229dcf805f220e8a1386c4547c37354261", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "New laws could significantly increase our tax\nobligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.

As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect\nour overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity\nmay not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have\nlimited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we\nacquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest\nportions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates,\nDrizly and Transplace. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a\ntarget for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the\napplicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.\nFurther, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.\nWe may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of\navailable cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate\nand execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and\noperating results may be harmed.\nIn addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and\ntechnologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and\nexpansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies\nregarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and\ndoing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing\nsignificant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis.

Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or\nreputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar laws outside the United\nStates. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective,\nand such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these transactions will be\naccretive to the value of our common stock.

In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements\nor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or\nlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an\nexisting license or permit.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us\nto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject.

These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations\nhave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council\nvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire\nvehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion.

As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our\nMobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled that we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes\nto our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched Mobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to\nblock Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in certain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the\napplicability of these laws and regulations to our products and offerings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our\nability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to continue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject\nto scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this practice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers\nimposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our licenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such\nfines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on\nour platform. In many instances, we make the business decision as a gesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers\u2019 defense costs,\nwhich, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of dollars. Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage\nDrivers and consumers from using our platform and could adversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by\nour competitors or from local governments globally, that have favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential\nDrivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle certifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps\nwith respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur,\nsignificant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our\noperations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and\ngrowth would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\nAs of June 30, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 70 countries. We are subject to differing, and sometimes\nconflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional,\nand local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\nCertain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we\noperate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be\nadopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and\nregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-\nmarket in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that\nlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively\nchallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing\nservices.

Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to\nhave been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to\nshare certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordance\nwith these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt on\neither a temporary or indefinite basis.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), an event commonly referred to as Brexit. The UK\nrepresented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings during the six months ended June 30, 2022.\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia on\nbehalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions of Australia during certain\nperiods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods. These legislative and\nregulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in financial damages or\npenalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which could harm our ability\nto operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating\nresults.\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access to\ndockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other\nMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The\noccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative\npublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of\nanti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too\nhigh (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our\nbusiness, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or\nfines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose\nsignificant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including\nlimitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.

Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve\nsubstantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to\nStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate\neach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our\nplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our\nplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,\nand prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not\ncompleting all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received\nby those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment\nprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined\nwith changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments\nregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money\nlaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. Effective\nJuly 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by the\nEuropean payments regulations.\nIn addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to money\ntransmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds\ntransfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export\nrestrictions. Our business operations, including our payments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations.\nHistorical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets, or\nother enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on our\nability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,\nand payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering\nand sanctions laws, and in the EEA to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider.\nGovernment authorities may seek to bring legal action against us if our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk\nmanagement or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to our\nbusiness.\nWe currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, other federal, state and local government\nagencies and other foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.\nWe are the subject of DOJ inquiries and investigations, as well as civil enforcement inquiries and investigations by other federal, state and local government\nagencies and other regulators abroad.

Any of these developments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,\nlegislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.\nThese and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection, and other laws. Such\nviolations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory\nentities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been the\nsubject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuant\nto which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how we\nprotect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,\nfuture failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately\n$1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered into a\nsettlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In addition, in September 2018,\nwe entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved\npayment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices.

Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\nstates have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil\nprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.\nThese laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights\nAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received\nheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the\nadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.\nIf we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer\npersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement\nfor obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or\nperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in\nthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data with\ncertain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,\nand ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions\nto suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a\ntemporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation\nsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner\nin which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus\ncompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,\ndisclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived\nfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by\nindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if\nfound liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.

However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome.\nFurther, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public\nscrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in\nany legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15,\n2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules\nbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of\nprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we\ncould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,\ninvestigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA\nand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties\nfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to\nadditional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of\ncorruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or\nbusiness partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our\nacquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be\nfamiliar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and\ncompliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held\nresponsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the\nidentity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.\nDrivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our\nplatform.\nMany Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific\nregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be\nlicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers\nmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of\nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations\nthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours.

We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a\nlimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot\nguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other\nautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general\nliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner\nunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and\nCanada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant\nadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the\nrisk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our\ninsurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by\nus through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and\nindustry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have\nrequirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our\nunrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who\nuse our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings\non our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability\ninsurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to\nhave been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result\nin liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid\nclaims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative\npublicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by\ngovernmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.\nAdditional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service\nproviders and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with\nus. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in\nproceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative\npublicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5340, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77baaff9-1f4b-4818-9d71-6531edafa822": {"__data__": {"id_": "77baaff9-1f4b-4818-9d71-6531edafa822", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3a6cf7b-b8a7-4184-8bc0-d280e0e27499", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "bad093f0dda1773f0c78d5d3d15492f73562d4e0ea47ddfaef3b3e898f6ee4c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f828b53-251e-4d4f-81bd-e5b1f27eeb4e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_june_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1238483, "creation_date": "2024-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-17"}, "hash": "27d58b8f06da22424184fcb61a0ca6448bd88e211afb916760d3d7cc0e74a6f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cabf1f1e-962f-4bd1-8f0f-dc203215bd14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4da1650e9d142ef7f22815c53e1cfec9a1e92171c8e807f9f24bcd2164cf0b86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.\nAdditional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.

Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have\nbeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate\nconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.\nFurther, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.\nAdditional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business.

Often, their\nstock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class\naction litigation following periods of market volatility.
