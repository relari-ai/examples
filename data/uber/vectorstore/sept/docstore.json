Business\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is atechnology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connectsconsumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery andother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shippers (\u201cShipper(s)\u201d) with carriers (\u201cCarrier(s)\u201d) in the freight industry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment,transportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles inthe United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) regarding interim financial reporting. Thecondensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omittedpursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the auditedconsolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Theresults for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of thefinancial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented.\nThere have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filedwith the SEC on February 24, 2022 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nBasis of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest andvoting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Refer to Note 13 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates andassumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, whereapplicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, we considered the impacts of the coronaviruspandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments. On an ongoingbasis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement ofcredit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairmentof goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and othercontingent liabilities.

Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models usingmarket observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quotedmarket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist ofcommon stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately heldcompanies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019sfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of theenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information byusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available marketdata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used inthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach isemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around theinvestees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, couldresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, andvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In thefuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30,2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nNon-marketable Equity Securities Note Receivables MLU B.V.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as themeasurement alternative) or for impairment.

During the first quarterof 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other income(expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of theRussian economy as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencingrevenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.\nMLU B.V. Basis Difference\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate shareof the net assets of MLU B.V.

The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liabilitycomponent (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes.

We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $(101) million and $(395) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively,and $58 million and $(97) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, theincome tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, by the benefit of U.S.losses and current tax on our foreign earnings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferredChina and U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Didi, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora and Zomato, and to a lesser extent,the benefit from our U.S. losses and current tax on our foreign earnings. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, the income tax expense was primarilydriven by the current tax on our foreign earnings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferredU.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, and Didi, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effectivetax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, and Didi, the valuation allowance on ourU.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $247 million, none of which would impact theeffective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreigntax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years inwhich the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. Forour major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom(\u201cUK\u201d), and Australia.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefitswithin the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate thefull range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operatinglosses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through September 30,2022. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nNote 10 \u2013 Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted netloss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertiblesecurities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\nWe

(\u201cCODM\u201d) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operatingdecisions and evaluates operating performance.\nOur three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\nSegment Description\nMobility Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant orhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery aswell as select other goods.\nFreight Freight connects Carriers with Shippers on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book ashipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region, refer to Note 2 \u2013Revenue.\nOur segment operating performance measure is segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and,accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue,operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. SegmentAdjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the tablebelow).

Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiaryreinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to ourcaptive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the amount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d). Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities onthese policies when taken together with previous risk transfer arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River weretransferred to a third-party claims administrator for ongoing handling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the TransferredClaims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021, and adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, werecognized a $103 million charge in our condensed consolidated statement of operations consisting of the difference between the Premium and the assumedliabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses associated with the LPTA, and the adverse development on the Transferred Claims.\nNote 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various claims, non-income tax audits and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021 andSeptember 30, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion, of which $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters in accrued and other currentliabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independentcontractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfaircompetition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d)claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and auditproceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of CaliforniaState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number ofmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount orrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results ofoperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matterswere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materiallyadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect.

The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed apetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result ofthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required tocomply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. andRasier Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the Appin 2014 as dependent workers of Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the FederalTribunal and has no impact on our current operations. On June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by which both Drivers and Couriers in the canton ofGeneva are classified as employees of Uber B.V. and Uber Switzerland GmbH.\nFollowing this ruling, we received a request for information from the SVA Z\u00fcrich that states that Couriers shall be considered employees for social securitypurposes since the launch of Uber Eats.

We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing atthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment lawpurposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlementof historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who arenot already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place for claimants whohave not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\n30", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3760, "end_char_idx": 6013, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39460d0f-594f-4b22-af34-2b2aa3c12a52": {"__data__": {"id_": "39460d0f-594f-4b22-af34-2b2aa3c12a52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fb5660d4-784d-40aa-96d9-7b83a7fa18d5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "9036b5392602a5bc21fb2eafde0851bb461116ca3d0b569ef2c64f0062385ff4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "785d7187-dabd-498d-9a29-32213879c2ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15e8f7d20107a7bed5419bcae314a1dfa1800db4ec0a5c5f20bde21eb392df8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.

As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock, including 4.6 millionrestricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees. In addition, we issued 4 million stock options to replace assumed outstanding stock options. Thesereplacement stock options attributable to post-acquisition service were included in our option activity and were recognized as stock-based compensation expense.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gainor loss in our condensed consolidated statement of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2021. In connection with this acquisition, thepreviously recognized non-controlling interest was derecognized. Following this transaction, Cornershop became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nThe total purchase price was determined to be $967 million, based on the number of shares issued and Uber\u2019s share price on the closing date. The fair value ofthe 4.6 million restricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees was determined to be $202 million. These shares are restricted and contingent on theemployees\u2019 continuing employment at the combined company for three years, beginning in August 2021. These restricted shares are considered compensation forpost-combination services and will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense ratably over three years, beginning in August 2021.\nNote 16 \u2013 Divestiture\nDivestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business, a subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization ofautonomous vehicle technology, to Aurora. As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownership ofthe ATG Business transferred to Aurora.\nAs consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third-party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A StatedLiquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interests on our condensedconsolidated balance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in theform of Aurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested$400 million in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest ofAurora.\nWe do not consolidate Aurora under either the VIE or the voting interest model.\nWe entered into a commercial agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with best efforts to launch and commercialize self-drivingvehicles on our ridesharing network. We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continueto vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora. As a result, we initially recognized liabilities of $315 million as considerationfor these future obligations to Aurora.\nThe sale of the ATG Business did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore doesnot qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation. Our ATG Business was included in the ATG and Other Technology Programs segment prior to this transaction.Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, results of ATG and Other Technology Programs are included within All Other.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidatedfinancial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidatedfinancial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussioncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statementsand Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by theforward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point Ato point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers ofride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with publictransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freightindustry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologiesthat provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to thealleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019spreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda CountySuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the CaliforniaCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument has yet to bescheduled in that matter.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, resultsof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) EmploymentTribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK ratherthan independent contractors.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5284, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7745271-48bc-44c4-9e2c-17c7dc146471": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7745271-48bc-44c4-9e2c-17c7dc146471", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b162d6a6-78fe-4f36-a479-6f8788e2c056", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "f32d0231501eb71367b1128480e575ab2cc6343c26bd056efece16e39e49eae3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4df1f80e-2438-4d2b-a1a3-bb5769928b94", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "9eaf9904a411a113664ac8b1e4f47b5af2bc8057aecbbbaab6198c3ddd9c6d9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Oral argument has yet to bescheduled in that matter.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.

The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and ableto take trips, based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealedto the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UKdrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.\n35", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4525, "end_char_idx": 6124, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8081e86b-7f8b-47cd-963d-fff3a332f0b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "8081e86b-7f8b-47cd-963d-fff3a332f0b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "158ea535-0e45-48f2-b0d6-860a9e1d3d2c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "6c8d5ad807927023480af2b4bdbbdae56d14797026f43699f5e6e20048e66684", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith Uber.

For example, we temporarily suspended ourshared rides offering globally, and recently re-launched our shared rides offering in certain regions, and continue to offer \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options forDelivery offerings. We also responded to COVID-19 by launching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those relatedto delivery of food and other goods.\nFurthermore, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, Driver supply constraints.

We have concluded that we are an agent in thesearrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driverincentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobilityservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in thetransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible formobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers inexchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,\u201d \u201cNote 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - RevenueRecognition,\u201d and \u201cNote 2 - Revenue\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,2021 and Note 2 \u2013 Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, creditcard processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportationservices, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we areprimarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Tripvolume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-locateddata center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations incities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customersupport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on anabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertisingcosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation ofcertain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for theforeseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design andproduct development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. Weexpense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research anddevelopment activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs, offset by adecrease in investments in our ATG and Other Technology Programs subsequent to the sale of our ATG Business in 2021.\n38", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5109, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc8b872d-d0d7-4779-bd08-d389aae3395b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc8b872d-d0d7-4779-bd08-d389aae3395b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a82c012-de1e-4b9d-a8a7-fd191ff171e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "a6a555b70973a7f3628440ac27c85c6b94a2a6bfdb2d2c5aed40770e833921ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "General and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management andadministrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well asallocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs.

The preparation of these condensedconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, andrelated disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Weevaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differencesbetween these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nFor additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I,Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statementsincluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $239 millionas of September 30, 2022.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cashequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $8.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Wedid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of September 30, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk.Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to valuegiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. Theseinvestments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fairvalue of these investments.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5031, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abf0a64d-441c-417f-9331-685d025ef927": {"__data__": {"id_": "abf0a64d-441c-417f-9331-685d025ef927", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "925a78ce-3ce6-41a2-bf77-caaafd4379b7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "4a2c77c79d85f2e630ea4a1fc0331dcd5cf528375916865cbbf2fbbe457c6d20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae4ddc3c-35f8-45a2-ac54-56af7b9884bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "7f493b889f8b832b043c5e1a4976ce90a0a6e3f9f0312b3ac952783e05a47e17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that wefile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of ourdisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls andprocedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe acquired Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in November 2021. As part of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, we arereviewing the internal controls of Transplace and are making appropriate changes as we deem necessary. Other than the controls related to Transplace, there wereno changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or arereasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controlover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, ourmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that itsobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all controlissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We denythese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for thematters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legalproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims relatedto the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States wherewe may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations inwhich we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary andinterim rulings.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the followingrisks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and the relatednotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Ourbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do notbelieve are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\u2022 Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\u2022 The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\u2022 To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\u2022 We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n55", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5128, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "291eda33-8fe6-4c0a-874e-afb0d653bd2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "291eda33-8fe6-4c0a-874e-afb0d653bd2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e26f0a13-04e5-47fd-901e-c50fd23cfee4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "0c32905275ba8d4dfab7d7a707bc13e8e8537501ba02d9ae2b1c6896d5645785", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u2022 If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\n\u2022 Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planningcould adversely affect our business.\n\u2022 Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects.

You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid andmay lose all or part of your investment.\nOperational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business\nOperational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, andprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individualsettlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $477 million as of September 30, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legalproceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negativelyimpact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independentcontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independentcontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to befiled.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expensesassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5310, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45ef85c0-66e6-4b81-90a1-1f9b898b1f03": {"__data__": {"id_": "45ef85c0-66e6-4b81-90a1-1f9b898b1f03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e387fe7-a5a1-47a4-8158-00e359579092", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "6ebd49ab11ecf993c71803ee840b9c42792bb1070261ff46fba8366b7f261a97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6ef5d02-8de5-4bce-90dc-08771dc9d243", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "d1b385d264ca95fe93115c14f3057a4f58acee19ef75622bd7f4b8856a722f11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to befiled.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions.

In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly affected.Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and wemay not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change ourbusiness model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash\n57", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4333, "end_char_idx": 5998, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f0c92ea-ac81-409d-a694-4dba166c5d9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f0c92ea-ac81-409d-a694-4dba166c5d9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9858fabf-b947-48e3-9273-9dea8eb4fb38", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "b512d9068d0bf0f7bc1cfdd67a72a3010fd00c15751d4b43fb226f395d8ede7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2b217d55-c65e-4080-a587-dc7536703b7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d512428b583f0fef889180197e68655b843e5d49816d7641cfa0be21966587c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "flows.\nAnother example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by theEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, goingforward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status),decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Driversbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number ofDrivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financialcondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCriticalAccounting Estimates\u201d included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, lowbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.

We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity toshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on alimited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner thanwe do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition.

These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed inincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increaserevenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect toadd value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lowerservice fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in anegative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers.

In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives toimprove our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\nOften, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely beviewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and securitybreaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers andmerchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform.

Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, weannounced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.

We may not be able to manage our growth effectively,which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 32,600 global employees as ofSeptember 30, 2022, of whom approximately 19,100 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside theUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,including engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our newhires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining ourexisting employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions inworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction inworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficultfor us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properlymanaging our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so couldlikewise harm our business.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slowresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improvethe technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controlsover financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve ourtransaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially withrespect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolvingrisks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our currentand planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations.

We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls aswell as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow andmature in these areas. If we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to addresscompetitive challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.\nIf platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability toattract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business,financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or otherwise, and we may be unableto protect or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers, and third parties.

In addition, certain regions where we operate have high rates of violent crime, which hasimpacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports of Drivers and consumers beingvictimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform.

On a smaller scale, we may facelitigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, thegrowth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users andface a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or unevenroadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas,need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours, all ofwhich heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we areexposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherentlyrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing newtechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in severalcountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiaryUber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight\u2019s business through Transplace\u2019s expertise in transportation management. We also plan to investsignificant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend ourdevelopment budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy.Our new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we havelimited or no prior development or operating experience.

and\n\u2022 reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.\nThese risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.\n65", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4206, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2afcf5d9-6253-40cd-9bd9-48cc8b284ca6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2afcf5d9-6253-40cd-9bd9-48cc8b284ca6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "314b47e1-ca0d-4043-a107-b06070ce75f6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "0dec94dec494a42d4c9fd3c782455db016f4ab578575fd69c870788df2991a2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f425586a-d873-45a8-b89d-8ba3bed098df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "edd32c6009f60a36f095abff07a082509188c21839131b12125a17aca124c915", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Our growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering withand investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategyhas also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in ourcompetitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, ourYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, and Aurora.\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control.

We are not represented on themanagement teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, ourYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime andAurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these companies may make decisionsor take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally, these companies have expanded theirofferings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets throughout the world. While this couldenhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would be adversely affected bysuch expansion into markets in which we operate.\nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of theseassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affectsuch valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies couldadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companieshave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limitedpublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particulareconomic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; aredomiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and effortsof a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect onthe relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitivepositions. For example, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, members of our management team resigned from the board of our Yandex.Taxi jointventure, and we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in the joint venture. The broaderconsequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensionsbetween the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these riskscould materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of ourcommon stock.\nFurther, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora\u2019s November 2021 initial publicoffering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora.

In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, andtypically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certaincities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as aresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in ourrevenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonalfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth ofDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders.

As such, we may not accurately forecast our operatingresults. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significantportion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting inlosses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all ofthe value of their investment.\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial resultsand future prospects.\nOur Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that theywill continue to slow in the future.

In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemmingfrom continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrierdemand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees invarious jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adverselyimpacted.

An economic downturn, increasedcompetition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a muchgreater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areasthat affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable torenew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in suchmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid,the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and ruralareas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market wouldbe limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, ouroperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and fromairports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobilityand reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating thatridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operationsaltogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Suchactions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers.Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. Inaddition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, thenumber of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we recently implemented our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challengesmaintaining our corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, increasing attrition orlimiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress andsocial isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or additional negative publicitycould lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.\nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans. We may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\nIn addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.

We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in September 2022, we experienced acybersecurity incident where an attacker accessed several internal systems; the investigation regarding this incident is ongoing. As an earlier example, in May 2014,we experienced a data security incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key writteninto code that an employee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the \u201c2014 Breach\u201d). In October andNovember of 2016, outside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the \u201c2016 Breach\u201d).

Forexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such newor upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users.

Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result inunexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and tools we use totrack these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While thesenumbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges inmeasuring how our products are used across large populations globally. For example, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even thoughwe prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how wemeasure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-termstrategies.

If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets inwhich Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, manyjurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to complywith these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in thosejurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks forDrivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safetyincidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any ofthese concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips.

Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and durationof extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-partysuppliers, and the business of merchants, Shippers, Carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs tomaintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% ofvehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Driversmay be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adoptedin London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent weexperience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise,including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\nWe have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to netzero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040.

In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we donot believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any future pandemic or outbreak of disease, on our business and financial resultswill depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variantsof the virus, both globally and within the United States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact oncapital and financial markets, the impact on global supply chains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business andwhether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic or any future outbreak of a disease will have on our business partners and third-partyvendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over theeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock priceand our ability to access capital markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect ofheightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are notcurrently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions,including slower growth or recession, inflation and higher interest rates, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results of operations. Forexample, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionaryperiods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-pointproducts over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, ormay reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business,financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tendto be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generallyconsidered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants inour network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which couldharm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or alternative opportunities forwork, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and usedvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and maycontinue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and Carriers when providing services on our platform.

This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss ofdata, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switchto another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data centerproviders are subject to the same risks.

The legislation andregulations promulgated in connection therewith remain unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as wellas interpretations and incremental implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen orincrease certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state andlocal taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. Beginning on January 1, 2022, the Acteliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize these expenses.Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision will berepealed or otherwise modified.

In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions orlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of anexisting license or permit.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help\n80", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5402, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8f9f6f6-6532-4733-8588-2f2b28791859": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8f9f6f6-6532-4733-8588-2f2b28791859", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee237d7-c29e-494e-a0f7-0cf25e154a46", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "236db50923ccc237c605b030bffd0e84fcbd62bf7de31dd5a3f2ee656d9b910e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "80f3f031-5176-4193-99b9-7b99c04ddcbc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a4edfef83adea5dd82b2d5eeb768c1748a09778755499a138aa7e3f4ad87d410", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "reduce congestion.

Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains.Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and suchsurcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing triptaken in Chicago. In addition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that wentinto effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wagerequirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are beingconsidered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adverselyaffected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or thatwe believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who usedthe Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launchedMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas a gesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers\u2019 defense costs, which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of dollars.Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications.

We are actively challenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business,especially our ridesharing services. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, orgovernmental actions seeking to curb air pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions andimprove air quality in the city (including the institution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an\u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect in April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, andplan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition to electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehiclemiles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulationsin Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing toprovide. Our failure to share such data in accordance with these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against usor shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt on either a temporary or indefinite basis.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), an event commonly referred to as Brexit. The UKrepresented approximately 8.1% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, productliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Courtof Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions ofAustralia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,revenue, and operating results.\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negativepublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.

Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine thatcertain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, oursubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic moneyinstitution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and moneyremittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, UberPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. Wecontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and supportthe future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our businessoperations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease orlimit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or otherenforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we arerequired to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators mayblock payments to Drivers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs andinvolve substantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users notcompleting all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services receivedby those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumerscould adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide paymentprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European paymentsregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business.

Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including but not limited to, our business practices, such asfees, pricing, and related disclosures, relationships with third parties, and data privacy and security incidents. For example, in September 2018, after investigationsand various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulatedjudgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we enteredinto a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTCCommissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 millionrelated to the 2016 Breach. In addition, in July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling ofthe 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and it, as well as other security incidents we experience, may continue to lead to, costly and time-consumingregulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and internationalregulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued a proposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certaininformation, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US Safety Report. We negotiated the total payment to $9.15 million($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021. Investigations and enforcement actions fromsuch entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely disrupt our business.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories ofpersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. TheGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) specialcategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazilprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal dataoutside the EEA.

We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either atemporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions.

If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, wecould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costlylawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPAand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political partiesfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject toadditional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties.

Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition,it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on themaximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen newvehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growthprospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individualplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. Inconnection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negativepublicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging thesepractices.\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurancecarriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspectsof our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to ourMobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on alimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including generalliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a mannerunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States andCanada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significantadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of therisk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of ourinsurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained byus through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms.

These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and mayresult in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. Further, certain adverseoutcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.\nWe may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commerciallyreasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant royalties or license fees, which may increase our operating expenses.We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effort andexpense and make us less competitive. If we cannot license or develop alternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringingaspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of these resultscould harm our operating results.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles.\nThe accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our businessmodel, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in SEC or other agency policies, rules,regulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model and accounting methods could result in changes to our financialstatements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result inmaterially different financial results, and may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reportingcontrols.\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conduct theirbusiness activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under theInvestment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constituteinvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China), referred to elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as minority-owned affiliates, we believethat we are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed aninvestment company, such a determination would require us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply with restrictions imposed by theInvestment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would havean adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to therequirements of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assetsand pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance,and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations.

For example, beginning in September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state andfederal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws inconnection with our IPO. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, andseriously harm our business.
