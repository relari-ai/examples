"UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is atechnology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connectsconsumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery andother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles inthe United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) regarding interim financial reporting. Thecondensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omittedpursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the auditedconsolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Theresults for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of thefinancial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented.\nThere have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filedwith the SEC on February 24, 2022 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nBasis of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest andvoting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Refer to Note 13 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates andassumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, whereapplicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates,including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives ofamortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation;income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates areinherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.

Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models usingmarket observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quotedmarket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist ofcommon stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately heldcompanies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019sfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of theenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information byusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available marketdata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used inthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach isemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around theinvestees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, couldresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, andvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In thefuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31,2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nNon-marketable Equity Securities Note Receivables MLU B.V.

We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impactrelated to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022,the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, thebenefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are dueto the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets,and foreign tax rate differences.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would notimpact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreigntax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years inwhich the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. Forour major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom(\u201cUK\u201d), and Australia.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefitswithin the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate thefull range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operatinglosses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2022.Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nNote 10 \u2013 Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted netloss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertiblesecurities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\nWe

(\u201cCODM\u201d) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operatingdecisions and evaluates operating performance.\nAs of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\nSegment Description\nMobility Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant orhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery aswell as select other goods.\nFreight Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book ashipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 \u2013 Revenue. Our segment operating performance measure is segmentadjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general andadministrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items thatmanagement does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table below). The following table provides information about oursegments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2021 2022\nSegment adjusted EBITDA:\nMobility $ 298 $ 618 \nDelivery (200) 30 \nFreight (29) 2 \nAll Other (11) \u2014 \nTotal segment adjusted EBITDA 58 650 \nReconciling items:\nCorporate G&A and Platform R&D (417) (482)\nDepreciation and amortization (212) (254)\nStock-based compensation expense (281) (359)\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements (551) \u2014 \nGoodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets (57) (13)\nAcquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses (36) (14)\nAccelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets (2) \u2014 \nCOVID-19 response initiatives (26) (1)\nLoss on lease arrangements, net \u2014 (7)\nRestructuring and related charges \u2014 (2)\nLoss from operations $ (1,524) $ (482)\nExcluding stock-based compensation expense.\nIncludes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments.

As of December 31, 2021 andMarch 31, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income taxmatters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income taxmatters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independentcontractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfaircompetition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d)claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and auditproceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of CaliforniaState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number ofmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount orrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results ofoperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matterswere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materiallyadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workersperforming services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019scontrol, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type ofbusiness performed for the hiring entity.\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed apetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result ofthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required tocomply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, a rulingwas made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations B.V. arestill pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependentworkers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has no impacton our current operations.

Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revisedamount of the assessment and are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain,we recorded for this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.\nGoogle v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski\nOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach oftheir respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture tocompete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million againstAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted itsrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron andGoogle entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Googleon behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from thetrade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed toperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement, which wasformally approved by the court on May 2, 2022. The approval of the settlement and confirmation of Levandowski\u2019s bankruptcy plan is subject to appeal by May16, 2022, by certain creditors and the taxing authorities. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain given the possibility of appeals, we recorded forthis matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.\nNon-Income Tax Matters\nWe recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities withregard to such matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well asthe tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involvethe applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value added and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax onpayments made to such Drivers.\nWe are involved in a proceeding in the UK about our historic operating model in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking toclassify us as a transportation provider.

Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that wecharge Drivers prior to March 14, 2022. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, andHMRC is also expected to consider the UK Supreme Court\u2019s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers\u2019 worker classification, in determining whether we should beclassified as a provider of transportation services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach asatisfactory resolution after exhausting HMRC\u2019s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the UK Tax Court, which mayrequire the up-front payment to the Tax Court (\u201cpay-to-play\u201d) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritoriousdefense in these proceedings. As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportationand is required to remit VAT on Gross Bookings, which we are remitting under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987. As part of our ongoing discussionswith HMRC we anticipate that they will review our VAT remittance as a merchant of transportation.\nOur estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in certain jurisdictions,therefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.\n29", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4100, "end_char_idx": 6352, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29d2f06c-1c5a-4288-8bb3-eef3f85ff9e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "29d2f06c-1c5a-4288-8bb3-eef3f85ff9e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54028325-b47b-4a86-9be0-4ddc0ca3bede", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "2c3222a596030be768280a7379659d08ee067e0fc6fd0fe3a71e8ce62186235f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Other Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe have been subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our business practices, compliance withantitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws, securities laws, data protection and privacy laws, consumer protectionlaws, environmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights.

As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownership ofthe ATG Business transferred to Aurora.\nAs consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third-party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A StatedLiquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interests on our condensedconsolidated balance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in theform of Aurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested$400 million in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest ofAurora.\nWe do not consolidate Aurora under either the VIE or the voting interest model.\nWe entered into a commercial agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with best efforts to launch and commercialize self-drivingvehicles on our ridesharing network. We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continueto vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora. As a result, we initially recognized liabilities of $315 million as considerationfor these future obligations to Aurora.\nThe sale of the ATG Business did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore doesnot qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidatedfinancial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidatedfinancial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussioncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statementsand Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by theforward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point Ato point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers ofride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with publictransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freightindustry. We are also developing technologies that provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to thealleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019spreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda CountySuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the CaliforniaCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.

MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Deliveryorder on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on ourplatform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency oftransactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility or New Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberXShare ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 millionas of March 31, 2022.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cashequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We didnot have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market fundsand cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk.Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to valuegiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. Theseinvestments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fairvalue of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period oftime after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operatingresults as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversifiedacross geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter intoderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\nITEM 4.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5019, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "164134f2-d9a0-4201-9241-a1898be7da8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "164134f2-d9a0-4201-9241-a1898be7da8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6bd6cf75-071f-4b14-84cc-eb5292a2b158", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "72d3d380eab227940c478c69f897122570311c2448789af2490a4b13ab857ffa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0eb62aa1-a570-4f93-b878-bc069e1a257f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "75cbd2933ea23faaeef74aa86263300de8e9965f625e675b5dd683a5e3cdd7ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "dollar.

Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Ourbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do notbelieve are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of ourbusiness.\n\u2022 Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\u2022 The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\u2022 To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\u2022 We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u2022 If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\n\u2022 Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage andnegative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure tomaintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n\u2022 Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address thesechallenges may not be successful.\n\u2022 If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will beadversely affected.\n\u2022 Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which mayharm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\n\u2022 We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures areinherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\n50", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5153, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "225df258-6da3-4fb9-a69e-a52154f972fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "225df258-6da3-4fb9-a69e-a52154f972fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80e496f7-b46f-4a9f-82e3-34cc2c1faa78", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "c6afd13b78d258c816071cb8fa5e13b15d1567dbd4d8c17d016f6b1983f97173", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u2022 We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected byeconomic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.\n\u2022 We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or suchtechnologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered bycompetitors or non-autonomous vehicles.\n\u2022 Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planningcould adversely affect our business.\n\u2022 We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary orconfidential data, employee data, or platform user data.\n\u2022 Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operatingresults.\n\u2022 We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adverselyimpacted.\n\u2022 We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise,including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\n\u2022 We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products andofferings.

Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus,various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitationson social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example,by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions have been lifted and many regionsaround the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility\n51", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4653, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53b5a8bc-ea89-492f-b37a-476af60bbc77": {"__data__": {"id_": "53b5a8bc-ea89-492f-b37a-476af60bbc77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b32883ee-b9f1-4773-91fd-ed1cf6c8ad88", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "cda20a61c45d6312f97b76c7433ea5ffb786201e8f9a966ffcf9d9c24b95c4f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c41cc782-eea2-4f54-bfb3-484f6410933d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c21dbe44325d33ed796cdf48bd2b5e00a12acca7ce8b64856f0e755e7b6097b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "offering may not recover to pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and we areobserving that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, as such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted byconcerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict when Driver supply levels will return to pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, to support socialdistancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally, and our shared rides offering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has requiredand may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing modelsof our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we donot believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including theduration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, theadministration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supplychains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to ourend-users\u2019 behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be adverselyimpacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capitalmarkets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the otherrisks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, couldadversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, andprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individualsettlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $414 million as of March 31, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legalproceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negativelyimpact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independentcontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers by labor unions.

For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independentcontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.

For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expensesassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently havean adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAnother example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by theEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, goingforward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status),decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Driversbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number ofDrivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financialcondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCriticalAccounting Estimates\u201d included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, lowbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.

Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made itdifficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny,and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increasedtheir investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\nIn 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to haveoccurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safetyincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continueto result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Furtherunfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale andbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation couldhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates andCornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harmto their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certaindivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certaincontractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, weannounced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers,merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate thelaw, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that resultin harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining agood reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs,maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts.

If weare unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and futureprospects will be adversely affected.\nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business andhas placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, andinternal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affectour operating results.\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 30,900 global employees as of March 31,2022, of whom approximately 18,100 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside the United States toincrease as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff, includingengineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new hiresperform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existingemployees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions inworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction inworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficultfor us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properlymanaging our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so couldlikewise harm our business.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slowresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.

In particular, we will need to improve ourtransaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially withrespect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolvingrisks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our currentand planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hireadditional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, orcarriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors\u2019 platforms, which would adversely affectour business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, productsand offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally.

We have also faced civil litigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualificationprocesses and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety of our platform.\nIf Drivers or carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform asa conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not consider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result ofour business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents andallegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwiseengaging in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct whileusing our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain regions where we operate have high rates ofviolent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions.

On a smaller scale, we may facelitigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, thegrowth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users andface a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or unevenroadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas,need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours, all ofwhich heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we areexposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future.

operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.\nOur growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and

Our growth strategyhas also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in ourcompetitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, ourYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control.

As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of thesecompanies may make decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally,these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various marketsthroughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, andprospects would be adversely affected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.\nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of theseassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affectsuch valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies couldadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companieshave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limitedpublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particulareconomic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; aredomiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and effortsof a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect onthe relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitivepositions.

If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adverselyaffected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety offactors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, andtypically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certaincities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as aresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in ourrevenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonalfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth ofDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficultto detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonaltrends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate asa result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand ouroperations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace withtechnological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation,and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expenselevels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses andinvestments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed ourexpectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of theirinvestment.\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial resultsand future prospects.\nOur Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that theywill continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic andour ability to:\n\u2022 grow supply and demand on our platform;\n\u2022 increase existing platform users\u2019 activity on our platform;\n\u2022 continue to introduce our platform to new markets;\n\u2022 provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;\n\u2022 expand our business and increase our market share and category position;\n\u2022 compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\n\u2022 develop new products, offerings, and technologies;\n\u2022 identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\n\u2022 penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\n\u2022 reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like publictransportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\n\u2022 maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\n\u2022 enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and\n\u2022 increase positive perception of our brand.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives.

If our operations in largemetropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adverselyimpacted.\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Pauloin Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results aresusceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagiousdiseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in suchmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid,the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and ruralareas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market wouldbe limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, ouroperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to andfrom airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including bymandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have bannedridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or Drivers.

Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract, retain, and motivateemployees may not be as effective as in the past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase commensurate with expectations or consistentwith our historical stock price growth. If we are unable to attract and retain high-quality management and operating personnel, our business, financial condition,and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-costalternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and usedvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and maycontinue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs,increased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certaininternational markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, theseincreased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, theseincreased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchantsto cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased supply ofDrivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could harm our business and operating results.\nIf we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.\nWe collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 licensenumbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information.

For example, in May 2014, we experienced a datasecurity incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that anemployee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the \u201c2014 Breach\u201d). In October and November of 2016,outside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the \u201c2016 Breach\u201d).

Forexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features.

For example, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Terms ofService and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to thedata that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies.

If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets inwhich Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, manyjurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to complywith these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in thosejurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks forDrivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safetyincidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any ofthese concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cashreceived for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not alwayseffective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannotguarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to avariety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail,we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collectionfailure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact ourfinancial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card.

If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us onacceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees andother processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increasedfees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us.If these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and havecaused substantial Driver dissatisfaction and generated a significant number of Driver complaints.

From time to time, companies that use third-party open sourcesoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may besubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensingterms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software tomake available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designed to monitorour compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open sourcelicense review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms ofsuch license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-sourcesoftware license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of suchlicenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portionsof our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also presentadditional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise ourplatform. Additionally, because any software source code that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projectsbecomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would beunable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code.

U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017,and modified in 2020, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation andregulations promulgated in connection therewith remain unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as wellas interpretations and incremental implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen orincrease certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state andlocal taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. Furthermore, beginning on January 1, 2022,the Act eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize theseexpenses. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provisionwill be repealed or otherwise modified.

If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022.

Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage orreputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar laws outside the UnitedStates. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective,and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether\n74", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5265, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8389c142-8a3e-4264-9b44-3e1d02fda9d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "8389c142-8a3e-4264-9b44-3e1d02fda9d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e16b13d5-074f-4eff-a23a-c3ae99c3906d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/uber/uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-26"}, "hash": "e1ebb6f39cbd02ac1a061337686e92b976ea4b3d626a7aa18d9a9ebef1e04ee7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c46072d-8864-46b4-ba38-3468f2b808ba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a27114197a2bba95f5e8a87f07d1efc83b12988864bd6184eec91c8365b9ea7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "these transactions will be accretive to the value of our common stock.

Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions orlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of anexisting license or permit.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. Inaddition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or thatwe believe are invalid or inapplicable.

For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who usedthe Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launchedMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform.

Furthermore, such businesspractices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could adversely affect our revenue.In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, that have favored and may continue tofavor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle certifications. In addition, anincreasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to ourMobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our businessmodel in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory andother requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\nAs of March 31, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. We are subject to differing, and sometimesconflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional,and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how weoperate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws andregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medicaltransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are activelychallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharingservices. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effectin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California tohave been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us toshare certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordancewith these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt oneither a temporary or indefinite basis.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), an event commonly referred to as Brexit.

An increasing number of governments are enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims ofanti-competitive conduct.

For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European paymentsregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulations.\nIn addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission, online payments, and financial regulation.

We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand sanctions laws, and in the EEA to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider.Government authorities may seek to bring legal action against us if our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise riskmanagement or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.\nWe currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices and otherU.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.\nWe are the subject of DOJ criminal and civil inquiries and investigations, as well as civil enforcement inquiries and investigations by other governmentagencies, including state AG offices in the United States and other regulators abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, includingour business practices, such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, data privacy and security incidents, as well as data deletion and document retention policiesrelated to the 2016 Breach, which involved the breach of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed anddownloaded. We have in the past and may in the future, settle claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and variouslawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments andpayment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consentdecree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTCCommissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 millionrelated to the 2016 Breach.

Suchviolations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatoryentities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been thesubject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuantto which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how weprotect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,future failure to report security incidents.

For example, in January 2016, we entered into asettlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In addition, in September 2018,we entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involvedpayment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices.

We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations.

If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data securityincidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, andsignificant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personalinformation of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. If Drizlybecomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other datasecurity incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may notcover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically andinternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacyand security.

TheGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) specialcategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements.

We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either atemporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. Ifany of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit ourability to operate our business.\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legalproceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We aresubject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers\u2019 tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectualproperty infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any suchlitigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be timeconsuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources.

We are subject to the FCPAand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political partiesfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject toadditional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels ofcorruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, orbusiness partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Ouracquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not befamiliar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training andcompliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be heldresponsible.

However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number oflicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours.

In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs.

In addition, in early 2017,we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. Inconnection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negativepublicity.

As a result, our automobile liability and general liabilityinsurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed tohave been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face.

Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculateconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business.

In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectivenessof our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materiallyaffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\nThe process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly andchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in sizeand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline requiredfor a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintaininternal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable toconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and othereffective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nITEM 2.
