{"question":"What make Lisp macros distinct from popular languages?","ground_truths":["Lisp macros are distinct from popular languages because they are not commonly found in the intersection of popular languages, and their nature is such that implementing them properly in another language would likely require transforming that language into a dialect of Lisp."],"ground_truth_context":["Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection of popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp."],"metadata":[{"source":"..\/data\/graham_essays\/208_weird_languages.txt"}],"question_type":"Single Hop Reasoning"}
{"question":"Is good taste required for recognizing good art?","ground_truths":["Based on the context provided, it suggests that good taste is required for recognizing good art, as it states that the person who chooses the better art when shown a lot of works by artists they've never seen before has better taste."],"ground_truth_context":["Because if there is such a thing as good art, it's easy to tell which of two people has better taste.
